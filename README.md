# Editor-Tools-Playground

A personal project to test making tools in the Godot Editor

This repository is mainly for my own learning because a lot of the documentation on Editor Plugins in Godot is exclusively for GDScript so I want to be sure there are no discrepencies in workflow between C# and GDScript, and if there are, I want to know them.

## Why?

I believe that editor tools are what make games great. A well made tool save so much time compared to performing a tedious task over and over again. The easier it is to *just make something* the easier and more enjoyable it will be to finish your game.
